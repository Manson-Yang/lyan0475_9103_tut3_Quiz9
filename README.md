# ðŸŽ¨ Quiz 8: Imaging & Coding Technique Exploration

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration â€“ *Bauhaus Style*

Iâ€™m drawing inspiration from **Bauhaus-style artwork**, which uses geometric forms to express design principles and bold, vibrant colors for impact.

**Figure 1** illustrates a poster with rectangles, circles, and triangles, forming layered spatial relationships. I plan to use this clear structural language to improve layout readability and modern aesthetics.

**Figure 2** shows **asymmetrical balance**, a hallmark of Bauhaus, which conveys order while maintaining energy. Although replicating Bauhaus precision is complex, its principles will guide my layout and visual hierarchy.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration â€“ *p5.js with Geometric Primitives*

To implement Bauhaus-inspired layouts programmatically, Iâ€™ve selected **p5.js**, a creative coding JavaScript library. Its core featuresâ€”like `rect()`, `line()`, and color controlâ€”perfectly suit geometric visual languages.

**Figure 3** is a p5.js sketch that mimics Bauhaus aesthetics using simple shapes and limited colors. The example code (link below) combines visual clarity with compositional energy.
