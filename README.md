# ðŸŽ¨ Quiz 8: Imaging & Coding Technique Exploration

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration â€“ *Bauhaus Style*

For my assignment, Iâ€™m drawing inspiration fromÂ Bauhaus-style artwork, which uses geometric forms to express design principles while employing bold, vibrant colors for visual impact.
The first example (Fig 1) ![Figure 1](readmeImages/Fig1.jpg) demonstrates a Bauhaus poster composed of simple rectangles, circles, and triangles. These elements create distinct and overlapping spatial relationships, resulting in rich visual hierarchy. I plan to incorporate this clarity and structural approach into my layout to enhance readability and contemporary aesthetics.



Another key technique isÂ asymmetrical balanceÂ (Fig 2)![Figure 2](readmeImages/Fig2.jpg) , where dynamic compositions maintain order while exuding energy. This aligns perfectly with my assignmentâ€™s need for clean, purposeful design. While replicating Bauhaus precision may be challenging, its foundational principles will guide my approach to form and function.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration â€“ *p5.js with Geometric Primitives*
To programmatically implement Bauhaus-style design, I've identifiedÂ p5.jsÂ - a JavaScript library for creative coding - as an ideal tool. Its geometric primitives (such asÂ rect()Â andÂ line()) and minimalist color controls perfectly align with Bauhaus aesthetics.
For example, this p5.js sketch (Fig 3)![Figure 3](readmeImages/Fig3.jpg) demonstrates how basic shapes and a restricted color palette can create abstract compositions reminiscent of Bauhaus principles. The code example ðŸ”— [View Example Code](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2149233) shows how simple geometric elements can be combined to produce visually striking results that maintain the movement's characteristic clarity and boldness.
